/**
 * AR Snapshot — provider-agnostic open receivables as of a date.
 *
 * GET /api/reports/ar-snapshot?asOf=YYYY-MM-DD[&source=qbo|local]
 *
 * Returns rows shaped like the invoices table. Every downstream consumer
 * (Dashboard KPIs + all AR aging reports) buckets these rows by dueDate, so
 * they all reconcile to the same grand total.
 *
 * ── Multi-tenant design ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This app integrates QuickBooks, Xero AND Sage Intacct. Each provider's sync
 * writes the invoice's *authoritative open balance* straight from that
 * provider's books into a dedicated column:
 *     QBO   → qboBalance         (Invoice.Balance)
 *     Xero  → xeroBalance        (Invoice.AmountDue)
 *     Sage  → sageIntacctBalance (APBILL/ARINVOICE TOTALDUE)
 * …plus the provider's own dueDate and paymentStatus.
 *
 * So for TODAY we compute aging the same way for every tenant: take each open
 * invoice / unapplied credit, use its provider balance as the open amount, and
 * bucket by its dueDate. Because the balance and due date come from the provider
 * itself — and QBO, Xero and Sage all age by due date — this reproduces each
 * provider's aged-receivables report without any provider-specific code or a
 * live API call. One path, all tenants, fast and offline.
 *
 * For HISTORICAL dates the live balance no longer applies (it's "as of now"),
 * so we reconstruct point-in-time:
 *     - QBO connected → QBO's own AgedReceivableDetail (authoritative).
 *     - otherwise     → local event-sourced engine (best effort for Xero/Sage).
 *
 * `source` override (debug / reconciliation):
 *     source=qbo   → force QBO's native report regardless of date
 *     source=local → force the local event-sourced engine
