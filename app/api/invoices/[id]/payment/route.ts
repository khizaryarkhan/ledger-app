/**
 * POST /api/invoices/[id]/payment — record a payment against an invoice from
 * the collections UI (the Board's quick "record payment" action).
 *
 * This used to do `paid = (paid||0) + amount` directly on the `invoices` row:
 * no settlement link, no journal entry, no cash account. The money existed in
 * the collections UI and nowhere in the books — and it was silently discarded
 * the next time syncNativeInvoicePaid() recomputed `paid` from the links
 * graph (or, on a synced org, the next provider sync).
 *
 * It now posts a real Payment through lib/accounting/documents.ts, so the
 * money lands in the ledger (Dr Undeposited Funds / Cr A/R), a settlement
 * link is created, and `invoices.paid` is recomputed from that link by the
 * one writer that owns it. Nothing here writes `invoices.paid`.
