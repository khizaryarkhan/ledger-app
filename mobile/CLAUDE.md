# Prime Accountax — mobile app

React Native (Expo SDK 57, TypeScript) client for the accounting module's
floor operations. Talks to the same Next.js backend as the web app
(`../app/api/`), via a separate bearer-token auth path — see
`../lib/mobile-auth.ts` and `../app/api/mobile/`.

## Structure: tabs, then departments

Four bottom tabs are the app's permanent furniture
(`src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`). Everything else is a screen PUSHED onto
the parent stack, so a tab is always one tap away however deep you are:

| Tab | What it answers |
|---|---|
| **Home** | What can I do? — the departments |
| **Today** | What do I do next? — the prioritised queue |
| **Alerts** | What changed that I didn't do? |
| **Profile** | Who/where am I signed in as |

Deliberately NOT tabs: settings (a desk job), search (belongs in the list it
searches), and a "+" compose button — nothing here is created from nothing;
every action starts from a document or an invoice.

The Alerts badge counts only *actionable* items (`/api/mobile/notifications`
→ `actionable`). A badge for "you have invoices" would be permanently lit and
therefore ignored. There's no push channel yet, so `src/hooks/useAlertBadge.ts`
polls — foreground only, plus a refresh on resume so a badge is never
stale-by-hours after a phone leaves a pocket.

**Today** (`/api/mobile/receivables/today`) decides priority server-side:
broken commitments outrank merely-overdue invoices, because someone already
promised and missed. Each invoice appears in exactly ONE section — a queue
listing the same job four times reads as four jobs. For a role with
Operations it also folds in open POs to receive and SOs to ship, so a floor
lead sees both halves of their day.

**Alerts** (`/api/mobile/notifications`) is DERIVED from real records —
customer replies, disputes raised, commitments missed, invoices escalated to
you — not from a notifications table, and there's no per-user read state yet.
Nothing is invented; every row points at the invoice that caused it. Broken
commitments have no event row of their own (they happen by the calendar
moving), which is exactly why they need surfacing; they're dated on the
promise date so they sort where they actually occurred.

## Structure: departments

The app is organised by **department**, not by a flat list of screens
(`src/departments.ts` is the single source of truth). Each department
declares the roles that may use it, and `HomeScreen` renders only what the
signed-in role can actually do — a rep sees Receivables, warehouse staff
see Operations, an admin sees both. A section you can't act in is never
offered and then 403'd. Adding an area (Payables, Reports, …) means another
entry there, not another button bolted onto the home screen.

Role gating here is presentation only. The API enforces the same lines
independently: `canPostInventoryTxn()` for floor transactions,
`lib/receivables/rep-scope.ts` for a rep's book.

## Scope

**Operations — Receiving, Shipping.** The inventory workflows that make sense
on a phone (scan/select a document, enter quantities, submit).

**Production was removed (2026-09-27)**, along with its web equivalent
("Build", an ad-hoc production run against a BOM with no scheduling or
allocation) — both duplicated what a Manufacturing Order already does
properly, and only the ad-hoc version existed here; this app never had MO
support at all. Scheduling a Manufacturing Order needs lot allocation and a
status board, so it stays desktop-only until mobile gets a real (not
ad-hoc) production workflow of its own.

**Receivables — the whole rep portal.** Overview (total AR, overdue,
aging), the invoice list with server-side filters and search, invoice
detail with the actions a rep takes on a call (log a commitment, raise a
dispute, clear the response, add a note, move stage, share the PDF, call
or email the contact), promise/dispute history, the activity feed, My
Escalations, and customers rolled up by open balance.

Notably NOT ported: everything in the accounting module that's a dense
desktop grid — BOM builder, the 14-type document-entry form, GL/journal,
reports. Those stay web-only.

Extending this app means adding a screen pair (List + Detail) under
`src/screens/<area>/`, API bindings in `src/api/`, and an entry in
`src/departments.ts`.

## Receivables: server-side scope

The web rep portal fetches every invoice/customer/project/rep in the org
and filters the arrays in React, so `/api/invoices` hands a rep the whole
organisation's receivables and the scope is a presentation detail. Mobile
can't work that way (a rep on 3G shouldn't download the org) and
shouldn't: `lib/receivables/rep-scope.ts` recomputes the identical rule on
the server, and `app/api/mobile/receivables/*` returns only the caller's
slice.

The same helper closed a real write hole: the action endpoints take an
invoice id, so a rep could previously act on ANY invoice in the org by
supplying its id. `isInvoiceInScope()` now guards the promise, dispute,
response, PATCH, PDF and communications routes.

Actions go through `/api/invoices/[id]/response` — the canonical
"set the customer response" endpoint the board and portals share — so
promise ⇄ dispute ⇄ clear stay consistent and `recomputeInvoiceState`
syncs the stage. An outcome logged on a phone is indistinguishable from
one logged at a desk. The one mobile-only endpoint is
`/api/mobile/receivables/invoices/[id]/note`, which derives
customer/project/author server-side instead of trusting five fields from
the client the way `/api/communications` does.

Stage labels are fetched, never hard-coded: the summary endpoint returns
the org's own stage list (renames included) as `stageOptions`.

## Auth model

The web app uses NextAuth's httpOnly session cookie, which a React Native
client can't rely on. Mobile gets its own stateless JWT pair instead,
signed with the same `AUTH_SECRET` NextAuth already uses:

- `POST /api/mobile/auth/login` — email+password(+MFA), same verification
  as the web login (`lib/credentials.ts`, shared by both). Returns tokens
  directly if the user has exactly one org; otherwise a short-lived
  `preAuthToken` + the org list.
- `POST /api/mobile/auth/select-org` — exchanges `preAuthToken` + `orgId`
  for an access/refresh pair once the org list has more than one entry.
- `POST /api/mobile/auth/refresh` — rotates the pair; re-validates user
  status and org membership from the DB every time (a deactivated user or
  a removed membership is denied immediately, same guarantee as the web
  session).
- Every other route (`lib/api.ts` `requireOrg()`/`requireAuth()`) accepts
  `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` as a fallback when there's no
  cookie session — the bearer token is treated exactly like the
  `active_org_id` cookie for org resolution, then re-validated against the
  DB via the same membership/status checks the web path already uses. No
  new security logic was introduced; the bearer path reuses `requireOrg`'s
  existing DB re-validation end to end.
- No server-side revocation list (same stateless-JWT trust model as the
  web session). Access tokens are short-lived (1h); refresh tokens are
  30 days and re-validated on every use.

Tokens are stored via `expo-secure-store` (`src/api/client.ts`), which
auto-refreshes on a 401 and retries the request once before surfacing an
error.

Because the bearer token lives in SecureStore and not in a cookie, the
system browser can't fetch an authenticated URL. So the invoice PDF is
downloaded with the header attached (`expo-file-system`) into the cache
directory and handed to the OS share sheet (`expo-sharing`) — see
`src/api/pdf.ts`. Opening the URL directly would 401.

## Over-the-air updates

`expo-updates` is installed and `eas.json`'s production profile publishes to
the `production` channel. `runtimeVersion.policy` is **fingerprint**, not
`appVersion`, and that choice matters: a fingerprint is computed from the
native dependency graph, so adding a native module automatically invalidates
the runtime and the new JS will NOT be served to an older binary. With
`appVersion` you can ship JS that calls a native module the installed app
doesn't have, and it crashes on launch for every user who already updated.

So: **JS-only change** → `eas update --branch production` reaches phones in
minutes, no Play review. **New native module** (a new `expo-*` package, a
config-plugin change) → needs `eas build` and a Play upload; the fingerprint
changes and old installs correctly keep their existing bundle.

## Architecture choices

- **Navigation** — `@react-navigation/native` + `native-stack`, pinned to
  the versions Expo SDK 57 bundles
  (`node_modules/expo/bundledNativeModules.json` is the source of truth —
  `npx expo install` normally resolves these automatically, but its
  compatibility-check network call is blocked in some sandboxed
  environments, so versions here were pinned by hand against that file).
- **No global state library** — auth lives in `src/auth/AuthContext.tsx`;
  screens fetch their own data with `useFocusEffect` so switching tabs/back
  always shows fresh open-PO/SO/BOM lists.
- **`API_BASE_URL`** (`src/config.ts`) comes from `app.json`
  `expo.extra.apiBaseUrl`, overridable via `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` — a
  phone/simulator can't reach a laptop's `localhost`, so point it at a LAN
  IP or tunnel URL while developing against a local backend.

## Web preview — for reviewing UI changes before a build

`npx expo start --web` runs the same app in a browser via react-native-web.
This is NOT a build target we ship — Play/App Store users always get the
native binary — it exists purely so a change to a screen can be looked at
in seconds instead of waiting on an EAS build.

It works because the two native modules with a login-path dependency both
ship web stubs: `expo-secure-store` (falls back to localStorage) and
`expo-file-system`/`expo-sharing` (present but inert). The one place that
matters: `src/api/pdf.ts` exports `canSharePdf` (`Platform.OS !== "web"`),
and `InvoiceDetailScreen` only offers the "Share invoice PDF" button when
it's true — downloading a PDF has no web equivalent, so the button is
hidden rather than offered and failing.

Anything else that's native-only in the future should follow the same
pattern: a `Platform.OS` check gating the feature, not a crash on web.

Known gaps versus the native app: no camera/barcode scanning (not used
yet), no push notifications (not implemented at all yet, native or web),
touch-sized tap targets look slightly oversized with a mouse. None of these
block using it to review layout, navigation and data — the actual UI code
run in both places is identical.

## Not yet tested on-device

This app was written in a sandboxed environment with no simulator/device
and no Metro bundler run — `npx tsc --noEmit` is clean, but nobody has
actually run `npx expo start` against it yet. Before trusting it: run it
against a real backend, sign in, and walk all three flows end to end.
