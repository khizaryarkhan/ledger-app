/**
 * Departments — the top-level structure of the app.
 *
 * The app is organised by department rather than by screen, so new areas
 * (Payables, Reports, …) slot in as another entry here instead of another
 * button on a flat home screen.
 *
 * Each department declares which roles may use it. The home screen only shows
 * what the signed-in role can actually do — a collections rep opening the app
 * sees Receivables and nothing else, warehouse staff see Operations. That's
 * both clearer and honest: a section you can't act in shouldn't be offered
 * and then fail with a 403.
 *
 * Roles come from the org membership (`users.role` / `user_organisations.role`):
 *   rep            — "Rep / PM": field collections. Receivables only; reps
 *                    don't move stock (`canPostInventoryTxn` excludes them).
 *   company_user   — "Full Access" staff: both departments.
 *   company_admin  — everything in their org.
 *   super_admin    — everything.
 *   platform_admin — our own staff, not an org operator: no department. They
 *                    see an empty home screen rather than a section that 403s.
