/**
 * Accounting foundation reconciliation — the check that turns "our schema
 * follows QBO's model" into something that fails loudly instead of being
 * asserted in prose.
 *
 * Per org it answers five questions:
 *   1. Does every journal entry balance to the cent?
 *   2. Does the A/R control account agree with the open-invoice subledger?
 *   3. Does the A/P control account agree with the open-bill subledger?
 *   4. Is any document posted to a control account but missing from its
 *      subledger (the bridge silently dropped it)?
 *   5. Is any subledger document missing from the ledger entirely
 *      (off-ledger receivable/payable the books have never seen)?
 *   6. Does invoices.paid — a derived cache — agree with the settlement links
 *      graph that owns it?
 *
 * Only NATIVE documents are asserted. A provider-mirrored org's ledger lives
 * in QBO/Xero, so its GL is legitimately empty and comparing the two would
 * report false breaks.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — `invoices.source` / `ap_bills.source` are NOT usable to tell
 * native from mirrored: both default to 'native' and the provider syncs do
 * not reliably overwrite them, so synced rows are frequently labelled native
 * (thousands of them, each carrying a qbo_id). The trustworthy discriminators
 * are `journal_entry_id`/`entry_id` (ours) and the provider id columns
 * (theirs). Keying off `source` turns this report into noise.
 *
 * One implementation, two front doors: scripts/reconcile-foundation.ts (CLI)
 * and GET /api/admin/reconcile (platform-admin health check).
