/**
 * Maker-checker: should this posting be staged for a second, different

 * document in hand — the highest-risk step); Production/Goods Receipt/
 * Shipment are gated above an org-configurable value threshold. Checked by
 * each posting function (lib/inventory/jobwork.ts, production.ts,
 * receiving.ts, shipping.ts) BEFORE any write — if gated, the caller stages
 * the request via stagePendingApproval and returns `{ pending: true, id }`
 * instead of posting.
