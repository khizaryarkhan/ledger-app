/**
 * Job work / subcontracting — send owned material to a vendor for external
 * processing (knitting, dyeing, ...) and receive it back transformed, still
 * owned throughout. Neither a purchase (fresh cost, ownership transfers) nor
 * a sale (ownership leaves, revenue recognised) fits this: the material's
 * value just moves between two of the company's OWN asset accounts, plus a
 * genuine payable for the vendor's processing fee.
 *
 *   Dispatch:      Dr  Materials with Job Worker    Cr  Inventory (sent item)
 *   Each receipt:  Dr  Inventory (received item)
 *                    Cr  Materials with Job Worker    (this tranche's share of
 *                                                       the carried material cost)
 *                    Cr  GR/IR clearing               (this tranche's processing fee)
 *   Close:         Dr  Inventory Adjustments  Cr  Materials with Job Worker
 *                  (only if sent > received; the reverse if received > sent)
 *
 * A single dispatch may come back across SEVERAL partial receipts (see
 * job_work_receipts) — e.g. 100,000kg of yarn sent for knitting, returned in
 * 4 deliveries. Each receipt's material cost is a proportional slice of the
 * original dispatch cost (`sentAmount/sentQty` per unit), not the whole
 * amount — crediting the whole amount on every receipt would double-credit
 * the clearing account the moment there's more than one tranche.
 *
 * Wastage is NEVER assumed or apportioned into unit cost automatically. It is
 * only recognised when someone explicitly closes the order (closeJobWorkOrder)
 * — at that point, whatever gap remains between total dispatched and total
 * received is written off as its own visible GL line (Inventory Adjustments),
 * not silently folded into the received lots' cost. This keeps the received
 * item's unit cost equal to the SAME per-unit rate for every tranche, and
 * makes subcontractor loss reportable per vendor instead of hidden.
 *
 * The received item's lot cost = carried material cost + processing fee, so
 * downstream COGS reflects the true accumulated cost — the same principle as
 * a production build, but the transformation happened at a vendor's site.
 *
 * The processing-fee portion is recorded into the ordinary goods_receipts /
 * goods_receipt_lines tables (grirTotal = the fee only, never the material
 * cost) for EACH receipt, so the EXISTING three-way-match Bill flow
 * (lib/inventory/receiving.ts's billFromReceipts) bills the job worker for
 * their charge completely unchanged — we never owe them for material we
 * already owned.
 *
 * neon-http has no transactions — post the balanced entry first, then commit
 * lot movements keyed to the entry id, same discipline as receiving.ts and
 * production.ts.
