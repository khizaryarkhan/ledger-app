/**
 * Shapes the outgoing payload for an UPDATE. Pure — no I/O — so the

 * verified directly without a QBO connection.
 *
 * The decision: QuickBooks' sparse-update rule for the Line collection is
 * "a line without its own line-level Id is a NEW line; anything not
 * mentioned is left alone" — never a replace. Data Studio never round-trips
 * QBO's per-line ids (only the document-level Id/SyncToken), so every line
 * we send is always id-less — meaning sparse mode turned every edit into an
 * append, which is the exact bug reported: edit the lines in the downloaded
 * sheet, re-upload, and QuickBooks shows the new lines ADDED to the old ones
 * instead of replacing them.
 *
 * A FULL (non-sparse) update instead treats the submitted Line array as the
 * complete new truth: whatever isn't in it gets removed. That's what "I
 * edited the sheet" means, and it's the fix — but a full update also resets
 * any header field QBO tracks that we don't send. Our builders don't model
 * CustomField, so it's preserved from the existing record rather than
 * blanked (mirrors field-edit's merge, going the other direction).
