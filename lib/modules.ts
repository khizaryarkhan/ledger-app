/**
 * Per-org module assignment — which product areas an organisation has
 * access to. Manufacturing (BOM, production, job work, receiving, shipping,
 * lot traceability) is the first non-core module: assigned by a platform
 * admin, not self-service, since it's a vertical the org has bought into
 * rather than a preference they toggle. See CLAUDE.md "Modules & per-org
 * feature gating" for the full pattern.
 *
 * Client-safe (no `db`/server imports) — used by nav, the reports hub, and
 * the admin modules card. Server-side enforcement (`requireModule`) lives in
 * lib/modules-server.ts so it never gets pulled into a client bundle.
