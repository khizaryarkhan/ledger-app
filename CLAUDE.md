## What this is

**Prime Accountax** (primeaccountax.com) — a multi-tenant SaaS for **accounts
receivable (AR) management & collections**, integrated with **QuickBooks Online
and Xero**. It syncs invoices/customers, automates branded payment reminders,
tracks promises & disputes, and reduces DSO. There's also an **accounts payable
(AP)** side and an in-progress **native accounting** engine (standalone GL, so an
org can run without QBO/Xero).

- **Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, Neon Postgres,
  Tailwind, NextAuth, Stripe, Inngest (background jobs), deployed on Vercel.
- **Repo:** `github.com/khizaryarkhan/ledger-app`. Deploys auto on push to `main`.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # Next dev server
npm run db:generate    # drizzle-kit: generate a migration from schema.ts
npm run db:migrate     # apply migrations (tsx scripts/migrate.ts) — runs on vercel-build too
```

Needs a `.env.local` (DATABASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY, Stripe keys, QBO/
Xero client ids, etc.). **Local DATABASE_URL ≠ production DB** — don't assume data
parity. Some API routes need real keys, so a local `next build` can fail at
page-data collection for those routes even when the code is fine (e.g. an
accounting route needing an Intuit key) — that's an env gap, not a type error.
Verify changes with `npx tsc --noEmit`, which should be clean.

## Architecture & conventions

- **Multi-tenant:** every query is org-scoped. Helpers in `lib/api.ts` /
  `lib/billing.ts`: `requireOrg()`, `requirePlatformAdmin()`, `requireSuperAdmin()`
  (DB-revalidated, use for destructive/admin routes — never trust JWT alone).
- **Stripe is the source of truth for billing.** Never hand-edit billing state.
  Card data never touches the app (out of PCI scope).
- **Secrets** (mailbox passwords, OAuth tokens) are encrypted at rest via
  `lib/crypto.ts` (AES-256-GCM, keys from ENCRYPTION_KEY/AUTH_SECRET).
- **Real 1:1 collection emails** send from the admin's own connected mailbox
  (Gmail/Microsoft/SMTP). `support@foodready.ai`-style system mail is only for
  transactional/system messages.
- **Money:** `fmt.money()` in `lib/format.ts` deliberately rounds to whole
  numbers for scannability. GL/ledger columns use `numeric(14,2)` (stored as
  `.toFixed(2)` strings for Drizzle).
- **Theming:** app supports Dark/Light/System via CSS variables. The Tailwind
  palette (stone + accent steps) resolves through `rgb(var(--…))` in
  `tailwind.config.js`; token values live in `app/globals.css` (`:root` = dark,
  `[data-theme="light"]` = light). `ThemeProvider` (set on the app shell only)
  stamps `data-theme`. **Never build Tailwind class names at runtime** (string
  concat/`.replace`) — the scanner only sees literal class strings, so dynamic
  ones silently render unstyled. Use explicit literal ternaries.

- **Entry forms compose from `components/form-kit.tsx`** — the single source
  of truth for field styling (dark). Use `<Field>` (label→control→hint/error),
  `<Section>`, `<SelectField>`/`<CellSelect>` (custom chevron — never rely on the
  native OS `<select>` arrow), and the `control` (raised, for stone-950 panels) /
  `controlInset` (for stone-900 drawer panels) / `cell` / `th` tokens. Don't
  hand-roll input class strings in feature components — that's how the forms
  drifted into inconsistency before. The New Document form + all inventory
  drawers (Receiving/Shipping/Products/BOM/MO) are already on it.

## Module information architecture (Phase 1a, 2026-09-06)

Six top-level modules in the workspace switcher, in this order: **Receivables,
Payables, Supply Chain, Accounting, Reporting, Studio** (`components/sidebar.tsx`'s
`WORKSPACES` array). Supply Chain and Reporting only appear when their module
gate is on (`manufacturingEnabled` / `reportingEnabled`).

**The governing rule for where anything lives** (use this for every future
placement decision, not just this rewrite): **Supply Chain owns everything
that moves physical goods or commits to moving them. Accounting owns
everything that moves money or records what already moved.** Estimates stay
in Accounting because a quote commits nothing; Purchase Orders and Sales
Orders moved OUT to Supply Chain because they're a commitment to move goods,
even though no money has moved yet.

**No sidebar or Create-menu group may be named "Other", "More" or "Misc".**
If something doesn't obviously belong in a named group, that's a signal a
named group is missing from the design — say so and ask, don't invent a bin
to dump it in. (The Create menu's old "Other" group — Journal entry, Bank
deposit, Transfer, Bill of Materials, Manufacturing order, Production build,
Reconcile account, Add product/service, Add account, all mixed together — is
exactly the anti-pattern this rule exists to prevent.)

- **Supply Chain** (renamed from "Production" — same orange accent, same
  `manufacturing` module gate; UI-layer rename only, internal identifiers
  (`production_runs`, `/api/inventory/production`, `lib/inventory/production.ts`,
  the `BUILD-` numbering series) are untouched) — four sections:
  - **Purchasing**: Purchase Orders (`/accounting/trade/purchase-orders` — shared
    with Accounting, not moved), Goods Receipts (`/supply-chain/receiving`),
    Purchasing Reports (links to the shared `/accounting/reports` hub — there's
    no dedicated single page per report group, only per-report pages inside it).
  - **Manufacturing**: Production Schedule and Production Orders BOTH point at
    `/supply-chain` on purpose, not a bug — `components/mo-console.tsx` already
    IS the combined schedule/orders board, there's no separate screen for one
    without the other. Build (`/supply-chain/build`), Bill of Materials
    (`/supply-chain/bom`).
  - **Fulfilment**: Sales Orders (`/accounting/trade/sales-orders` — shared,
    not moved), Shipments (`/supply-chain/shipping`), Fulfilment Reports (same
    shared reports hub as Purchasing Reports).
  - **Inventory**: Stock Status, Lots & Movements (→ `/accounting/reports/lot-traceability`,
    the closest existing screen to a FIFO/movement audit trail — there is no
    dedicated "Lots & Movements" screen by that exact name), Products & Materials
    (`/accounting/products` — shared, not moved).
  - Old routes (`/production`, `/production/build`, `/accounting/receiving`,
    `/accounting/shipping`, `/accounting/bom`) permanently (308) redirect to
    their new `/supply-chain/*` homes (`next.config.js`) — bookmarks and old
    links keep working. `app/api/**` was NOT touched; the mobile app calls
    those routes directly.
- **Accounting**'s old "Master Data" section mixed the ledger itself with
  genuine setup/reference lists — split into **Ledger** (Chart of Accounts,
  Journal, Opening Balances, Trial Balance — always-expanded, core nav, not
  reference data) and **Setup** (Tax Rates, Classes, Locations, Cost Centres,
  Custom Fields, Employees, Products & Services — kept as the collapsible
  flyout "Master Data" used to be). Sales/Purchases sections now hold only
  Customers/Estimates and Suppliers respectively — Sales Orders, Purchase
  Orders, Shipping, Receiving and Bill of Materials all moved to Supply Chain.
  There's currently no dedicated Accounting-scoped list view for Invoices,
  Bills or Expenses as distinct screens (only the global `/invoices` AR
  screen and the `/accounting/new/[type]` create forms exist) — flagged, not
  invented, during the Phase 1a rewrite.
- **Known, deliberate duplication — NOT a bug, don't "fix" it on sight:**
  `/payables/purchase-orders` (Payables module's own PO screen) and
  `/accounting/trade/purchase-orders` (the trade-document PO, which Supply
  Chain's nav points at) are two separate, real screens over the same
  concept. Merging them is an intentional **Phase 1b** deferral, not an
  oversight discovered mid-session — don't rediscover this and "fix" it
  without that context.
- **Customer and Supplier are shared master data, not Accounting's to own a
  third copy of** (2026-09-06): Accounting's Sales/Purchases sections link
  `Customers`/`Suppliers` straight at Receivables' `/customers` and Payables'
  `/payables/suppliers` — the same rich list+detail screens those modules
  already have, not a separate thinner build. The old
  `/accounting/parties/customers`/`suppliers` screens (`components/party-list.tsx`'s
  `PartyList`, generic across customers/suppliers/employees) are retired for
  those two types and permanently (308) redirect to the real ones
  (`next.config.js`); `/accounting/parties/employees` is untouched — there is
  no Receivables/Payables equivalent for Employees, so that stays the one
  real screen for that type. See migration `0079_unify_parties.sql` and the
  "Accounting foundation" section below for the underlying data-model change
  this nav fix sits on top of.
- **Projects joined the same pattern (2026-09-07)**: Accounting's Sales
  section links `Projects` straight at Receivables' `/projects` (a
  customer-grouping entity, own rep/region reclassification) rather than
  building a second copy. This surfaced a real bug in the pattern:
  `components/sidebar.tsx`'s active-module detection was pure
  `pathname.startsWith(...)`, so landing on any shared entity's URL
  (`/customers`, `/payables/suppliers`, `/projects`) from Accounting
  force-switched the whole sidebar to whichever module owns that URL —
  confusing, reported as a bug. Fixed once, for all three: these paths now
  fall into the same `isChrome`-style "no module" bucket that Settings/Guide
  already used, so the sidebar keeps showing whichever module the user was
  actually in (`lastDept`) instead of snapping away. Apply this same
  treatment to any future shared-entity link, don't special-case it per
  entity.

## White-label Phase 1 — branded subdomain (2026-09-07)

Prompted by a customer request ("our name with the domain"), built as a
general per-org capability (any org, set from the admin portal), not a
one-off. Scope is deliberately narrow — a subdomain of ours, pre-auth pages
only:

- `organisations.subdomain` (nullable, unique when set) — an admin sets it
  on `/admin/customers/[orgId]` (the small subdomain editor next to the org
  ID in the header). `null` = no custom subdomain, org just uses the
  default app.
- **`middleware.ts` does NOT query the database.** `auth.config.ts` (what
  middleware's `auth()` wrapper runs on) is deliberately Edge-safe with "no
  Node.js imports (no bcrypt, no DB, no crypto)" — a constraint already in
  place before this feature and respected here. Middleware only does pure
  string parsing: for `<subdomain>.primeaccountax.com` on one of 4 pre-auth
  paths (`/login`, `/register/success`, `/forgot-password`,
  `/reset-password`), not a reserved word (`app`/`admin`/`www`/`api`/…), it
  sets a request header `x-org-subdomain`. The actual DB lookup happens
  downstream in `app/login/page.tsx` — now a server component that reads
  the header, queries `organisations` by `subdomain`, and passes
  name/logo down to the client `components/login-form.tsx`. A miss (no
  header, or no matching org) falls back to default Prime Accountax
  branding — this can never block a login.
- `next.config.js`'s `serverActions.allowedOrigins` gained a
  `"*.primeaccountax.com"` wildcard entry alongside the existing literal
  origins.
- **Manual step still required, outside this codebase**: a wildcard domain
  (`*.primeaccountax.com`) needs attaching to the Vercel project (Settings →
  Domains), plus the matching wildcard DNS record wherever
  primeaccountax.com's DNS is managed. The code changes alone don't make
  `<anything>.primeaccountax.com` resolve on the public internet — verify
  this separately before assuming a customer's subdomain actually works.
- **Deliberately out of scope, not forgotten**: outbound email branding
  (`lib/system-mailer.ts`'s `baseLayout` and every transactional email
  subject are hardcoded "Prime Accountax" globally, with no per-org
  parameter at all — a materially bigger, separate gap) and fully custom
  customer-owned domains (their own DNS + Vercel Domains API verification
  flow). The app shell itself (`components/sidebar.tsx`,
  `app/owner-portal/[token]/`) was already white-label-ready before this
  work — it already reads `orgSettings.logoUrl`/`displayName` with "Prime
  Accountax" only as the last-resort fallback.

## Modules & per-org feature gating

The product is expanding into vertical-specific functionality — Manufacturing
(BOM, production builds, job work, receiving, shipping, lot traceability) is
the first, more will follow. Every org has an `organisations.enabled_modules`
jsonb array (`db/schema.ts`) recording which `ModuleKey`s
(`lib/modules.ts` — `receivables`/`payables`/`studio`/`accounting`/
`manufacturing`/`resources`) it has access to. Existing orgs default to the
four core modules; `manufacturing` and `resources` are opt-in, assigned per
org by a platform admin via the **Modules** card on
`/admin/customers/[orgId]` (`PATCH /api/admin/organisations/[id]/modules`)
— not a self-service toggle, since each is a vertical the org has bought
into, not a preference.

- **`lib/modules.ts`** is client-safe (no `db` import) — `MODULE_KEYS`,
  `MODULES` (label/description/`core` metadata), `hasModule(enabledModules,
  key)`. Used by the sidebar (`components/sidebar.tsx`) to gate the
  Production workspace + the Accounting nav's "Manufacturing" group, and by
  the Accounting reports hub (`app/(app)/accounting/reports/page.tsx`) to
  gate the Stock/Purchasing/Sales report groups — `orgSettings.enabledModules`
  reaches both via the existing `data-provider.tsx` context (populated by
  `GET /api/org/settings`, same plumbing that already carries
  `reportingEnabled`).
- **`lib/modules-server.ts`** is server-only — `requireModule(orgId, key)`,
  mirroring `requireOrg()`'s `{ error }` return shape:
  ```ts
  const { error: modErr } = await requireModule(orgId!, "manufacturing");
  if (modErr) return modErr;
  ```
  Call it in every manufacturing-only API route (`app/api/inventory/**` except
  `items`/`skus`/`supplier-skus`, which are Products & Services master data
  every org uses regardless of vertical) — this is defense in depth, not just
  hiding a nav link, so a non-manufacturing org gets a real 403 hitting the
  route directly.
- **Keep the two files separate.** `lib/modules-server.ts` imports `db` —
  importing that from a client component would bundle server code into the
  client. Anything a client component needs (the admin modules card, the
  sidebar, the reports hub) must come from `lib/modules.ts` only.
- `organisations.reporting_enabled` (the original, one-off precedent for this
  pattern — a self-service boolean toggled in Settings, checked ad hoc in one
  API route and one nav spot) is intentionally **not** folded into this
  registry — it's a separate, working, unrelated feature. Don't extend it
  further; new gated features should use the module registry instead.

## Resource Management module (Phase 1: capacity & scheduling, 2026-09-09)

Requested explicitly as a NEW module, with an explicit constraint to check
first: "ensure you are not duplicating any existing thing, as we already
have projects in place." An audit confirmed `projects` is a pure
customer/invoice-grouping label (no dates/budget/resource columns),
`employees` is pure contact master-data, `reps` is a sales-collections
hierarchy, and `job_work_orders`/`manufacturing_orders`/`production_runs`
track quantities and only a `createdBy` audit stamp — nothing anywhere
modeled people/equipment capacity, scheduling, or allocation. This module
is additive, not a rebuild.

- **`resources`** (`db/schema.ts`) — a bookable person or piece of
  equipment. `type` discriminates `person`/`equipment`. `employeeId`
  (nullable) LINKS a person resource to an existing `employees` row rather
  than re-storing name/email — the resource always keeps its own `name` too
  so equipment (and a person whose linked employee is later removed) still
  displays correctly. `dailyCapacity` is hours/day for a person or
  slots/day for equipment (usually 1 = exclusive booking).
- **`resource_assignments`** — books one resource against a Project,
  Manufacturing Order, or Job Work order over a `[startDate, endDate]`
  range (`endDate` null = open-ended) at some `allocationPercent` of the
  resource's capacity. `assignableType`/`assignableId` is a **no-FK
  polymorphic reference**, same tradeoff as `transactionLinks.fromType/
  fromId` — adding a fourth assignable type later (e.g. Sales Orders) is a
  one-line addition to the type list, not a schema change. Over-allocation
  (>100% of capacity on an overlapping range) is computed at query time in
  `GET /api/resources/assignments`, not stored.
- **Module key `resources`** (`lib/modules.ts`) — opt-in, same precedent as
  `manufacturing`. The admin Modules card picks it up automatically (it
  iterates `MODULE_KEYS` generically, no per-key admin code).
- **Phase 1 is scheduling-only.** Time-tracking (actual hours logged) and
  any billing integration (billable time → invoice line) are explicitly
  deferred to a later phase — don't build them in without a fresh ask, the
  Phase 1 data model doesn't carry a rate or a billable flag.
- **UI**: a new top-level workspace (`components/sidebar.tsx`, pink accent,
  `CalendarClock` icon) — Resource Board (`/resources/board`, a from-scratch
  date-axis grid; confirmed no prior calendar/gantt component existed
  anywhere to adapt — `mo-console.tsx` is a status Kanban, not a date
  grid) and a collapsible Setup group (People, Equipment —
  `components/resource-list.tsx`, one component parameterized by `type`).
  `components/assigned-resources-panel.tsx` is a small read-only panel
  (module-gated, renders nothing if `resources` isn't enabled) added to a
  Project's detail page and reusable on MO/Job Work detail pages later.

## Stripe recurring billing — invoice-first two-step flow (2026-09-09)

A real customer invoice (14-day terms configured in the admin form) showed
Stripe's due date as the same day it was issued, and was later voided by
Stripe — root-caused against Stripe's own API docs, not guessed:

- **`days_until_due` only applies when `collection_method='send_invoice'`.**
  The old subscription-mode code
  (`app/api/admin/billing/create-invoice/route.ts`) created the Stripe
  subscription with `collection_method:'charge_automatically'` and never
  passed `days_until_due` at all — the admin form's "Payment terms" field
  was silently discarded for Recurring mode (it only ever reached the
  one-off branch).
- **The real bug, and the reason the invoice was voided**: Stripe's docs
  state, verbatim, for a `charge_automatically` subscription: "If the first
  invoice is not paid within **23 hours**, the subscription transitions to
  `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be
  voided and no further invoices will be generated." Nothing to do with the
  14-day field — it's fixed Stripe behavior for that collection method, and
  it isn't configurable away. `due_date`/`collection_method` also "can only
  be updated on `draft` invoices," so an already-finalized invoice like this
  one can't be patched after the fact — that's a manual/support matter, not
  a code fix.
- **Fix — two-step "invoice first, subscribe after payment"**, since a
  `send_invoice`-collected invoice and a `charge_automatically` subscription
  can't be the same object (and Stripe activates `send_invoice`
  subscriptions immediately regardless of payment, which would break
  `activateOrgOnPayment`'s payment-gated access):
  1. **`create-invoice` route, subscription mode**: creates a **standalone**
     Stripe invoice (`collection_method:'send_invoice'`, real
     `days_until_due`) for the first period's amount — same shape as the
     one-off branch (`invoices.create` → `invoiceItems.create` →
     `finalizeInvoice` → `sendInvoice`). Our `subscriptions` row is inserted
     as before (`status:'incomplete'`), but **no Stripe subscription object
     exists yet** — nothing for Stripe to auto-expire in 23 hours, and
     nothing for an admin to accidentally auto-cancel by voiding (see the
     `[id]/create-invoice/route.ts` comment below — that landmine no longer
     applies to invoices created after this fix).
  2. **`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`'s `invoice.paid` handler**: when
     the paid invoice carries `metadata.purpose ===
     'subscription_first_invoice'`, it retrieves the PaymentIntent's
     payment method, sets it as the customer's default, and creates the
     REAL subscription (`collection_method:'charge_automatically'`,
     `default_payment_method` set explicitly, `trial_end` one interval out
     so the period already paid for manually isn't billed again — the
     subscription just starts `trialing` and auto-charges cleanly at
     period 2). `activateOrgOnPayment` already runs unconditionally later
     in the same handler, so access-gating is untouched.
- **Guard against a second subscription**: if an org already has a live
  Stripe subscription when "Create Stripe invoice" is used again, the route
  now returns a 400 pointing at `/api/admin/subscriptions/[id]/create-invoice`
  (the existing "generate a new invoice for an existing subscription" tool)
  instead of silently starting a competing one. A dead subscription
  (`canceled`/`incomplete_expired`) doesn't block — it's cleared and a fresh
  invoice is issued.

## ⚠️ Gotchas that have bitten us

- **neon-http has NO transactions.** `db.transaction()` throws. Use
  pre-validation + a single multi-row statement, or compensating deletes with
  loud error logs. Never assume atomicity across statements.
- **Hand-written migrations** in `db/migrations/` need `--> statement-breakpoint`
  between statements, and the `meta/_journal.json` entry's `when` must be
  GREATER than the previous (drizzle skips entries with an older/equal `when` —
  this silently dropped a table in prod once). Latest is `0081` at `when`
  `1788900000000`; keep incrementing. (Keep this line current — it sat at
  "0025" for 50 migrations once already, which is worse than no note.)
- **Tailwind `content` globs must include `lib/**`** — classes defined in shared
  lib files were silently unstyled until it was added.
- Test migrations/backfills on a **Neon branch** before prod. Don't run
  destructive steps (NOT NULL, deletions) until a backfill is verified on prod.
- **`.env.local` can be many migrations behind production — verify before
  believing a local query.** A local DB here was missing 6 applied migrations
  while `vercel inspect --logs` truthfully reported "✓ Migrations applied"
  (to the real DB). Because the stale copy still held real-looking org data,
  a whole set of reconciliation findings looked credible and were wrong. Check
  `select max(created_at) from drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` against
  `meta/_journal.json`, or just use the in-app path (`/admin/reconcile`) which
  always runs server-side against production.
- **`invoices.source` / `ap_bills.source` do NOT reliably mean "native".**
  Both default to `'native'` and the provider syncs don't consistently
  overwrite them, so thousands of QBO/Xero-synced rows are labelled native
  while carrying a `qbo_id`. To tell ours from theirs use
  `journal_entry_id`/`entry_id` (ours) and the provider id columns (theirs).
  Filtering on `source` turns any ledger report into noise.

## Accounting foundation — invariants to preserve

The native transaction model is **already QBO-shaped**: `journal_entries` IS
the transaction header (`sourceType` is the `txn_type` discriminator, plus
`docNumber`/`dueDate`/`reference`/`txnNo`/`entryNumber`/`status`/
`sourcePayload`) and `journal_lines` ARE the typed lines, carrying full
dimensions (class/location/cost-centre/customer/project, QBO's Entity ref as
`nameType`/`nameId`/`nameLabel`, plus currency/exchangeRate/fx). There is no
need for separate `transactions`/`transaction_lines` tables. `lib/ledger.ts`'s
`postJournalEntry` is the single GL writer — immutable, reversal-only, which
is *stricter* than QBO's silent-edit-plus-SyncToken model. Adopt QBO's shape;
do not adopt its wire quirks (sparse updates, `Line`-append-on-update,
create-only `Balance`) — those belong quarantined in the sync/batch adapters.

- **One path per document type.** A document must have exactly one creation
  path, and it must post. Payables' bill endpoint used to insert a lines-less
  `ap_bills` header that never reached the GL (a liability visible in the UI
  and absent from the books); it's gone. Native bills post via `postDocument`
  and are mirrored into `ap_bills` by `bridgeNativeBill`; provider-synced
  bills are NOT posted (their ledger lives in QBO/Xero — posting ours
  double-counts).
- **The bridges must never fail silently.** `bridgeNativeInvoice` /
  `bridgeNativeBill` mirror a posted GL entry into the collections/Payables
  modules. `bridgeNativeInvoice` used to `return` quietly without a
  `partyId`, which left an invoice in the A/R control account with no
  receivable row — invisible to collections and AR aging. An Invoice now
  *requires* a picked customer (QBO mandates `CustomerRef` for the same
  reason) and the bridge logs loudly.
- **Derived state has exactly one writer.** `invoices.paid`/`paymentStatus`
  are a CACHE of the settlement links graph, written only by
  `syncNativeInvoicePaid` (native) or the provider sync (mirrored). It once
  had four competing writers, including a route that added to `paid` with no
  link, no journal entry and no cash account. `paidAt` must come from the
  settling document's `entryDate`, never `new Date()` — stamping "today"
  corrupts every historical-dated AR aging run.
- **Prove it, don't assert it.** `lib/accounting/reconcile.ts` checks, per
  org: entries balance; A/R and A/P control accounts agree with their
  subledgers; nothing is posted-but-missing-from-its-subledger; nothing is
  off-ledger; `invoices.paid` agrees with the links graph. Surfaced at
  `/admin/reconcile` (runs server-side against production) and as
  `scripts/reconcile-foundation.ts` for CI (exit 1 on failure). Run it after
  any change to posting, bridging or settlement.
- **Known remaining divergence (not yet fixed):** two settlement graphs —
  `transaction_links` (native, `numeric`) and `payment_applications`
  (QBO-mirror, `real`, raw-QBO-id keyed, written only by `lib/qbo-sync.ts`;
  Xero writes neither). `lib/ar-aging.ts` reads only the latter, so native
  partial payments age wrongly for any historical `asOf`. Open balance also
  has two answers: GL truth (`lib/accounting/payments.ts`) vs
  `invoices.qboBalance ?? total − paid`. Collapsing these onto
  `transaction_links` with `payment_applications` as a compatibility view is
  the next planned step.
- **`customers` and `ap_suppliers` are compatibility VIEWS, not real tables**
  (migration `0079_unify_parties.sql`, 2026-09-06): both party types now
  live in one physical `parties` table (`party_type` discriminator), because
  Accounting's Customer/Supplier screens had drifted into a third, thinner
  copy of the same concept — see the module-IA note above. INSTEAD OF
  triggers on each view forward INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/`.returning()` into
  `parties`, so every existing query against `customers`/`ap_suppliers` is
  unaffected — **except** a *new* foreign key can no longer target
  `customers.id`/`ap_suppliers.id` (Postgres can't FK to a view); target
  `parties.id` instead. `customers_legacy`/`ap_suppliers_legacy` hold the
  pre-migration data as an audit trail, not yet dropped. `ON CONFLICT` also
  doesn't work through a trigger-backed view — `lib/sage-sync.ts`'s one
  `onConflictDoNothing()` against `customers` was switched to plain
  check-then-insert; if you add a new sync/importer, insert into `customers`/
  `ap_suppliers` the same plain way, not with `onConflictDoUpdate/DoNothing`.

## Key domain concepts

- **Collections Board** (`app/(app)/board/`, `components/board-list.tsx`): the
  daily working screen. Rows = open invoices, grouped Customer→Project.
- **Stage** is the single dynamic state per invoice. The pill shows the richest
  state: Escalated (`→ Owner · Type`), Disputed (`· reason`), **Broken
  commitment** (a promise whose date has passed — shown in red, NOT "Committed"),
  Committed (`· date`), or a plain stage. Escalation/Committed/Disputed each open
  an inline picker. Stage & customer response are unified: `recomputeInvoiceState`
  in `lib/portal.ts` syncs promise→Committed / dispute→Disputed and reverts.
- **Escalation types** (`lib/escalation-types.ts`): stage stays "Escalated"; the
  *type* (Handed Over, Final Account, Retention, Legal, etc.) is the "why".
- **Linked transactions** (`transaction_links` table, `lib/accounting/links.ts`):
  a bidirectional, amount-tracking relationship graph — the native equivalent
  of QBO's `LinkedTxn`. Used for Estimate/PO→Invoice/Bill conversion,
  Payment/BillPayment→Invoice/Bill (incl. credit application), GR→Bill,
  Shipment→Invoice, and Deposit→Payment sweeps (`relation: "deposit_sweep"`,
  wired in `lib/accounting/documents.ts`'s Deposit branch via the form's
  optional payment picker). `fromLineId`/`toLineId` (migration `0064`) let a
  link target a specific `journal_lines`/`trade_document_lines` row, not just
  a document header — matching QBO's `TxnLineId`. No FK on `from_id`/`to_id`
  (or the line variants) — the type is polymorphic across
  `trade_documents`/`journal_entries`/their line tables, so a real FK isn't
  possible without a discriminated schema; same tradeoff QBO itself accepts.
  QBO/Xero-synced orgs use a **separate, parallel** mechanism —
  `paymentApplications` (`lib/qbo-sync.ts`, raw-QBO-id-keyed, feeds
  `lib/ar-aging.ts`) — because their invoices/payments live in their own
  mirror tables (`invoices`/`payments`), not the native GL; this is the
  already-tracked, much larger Accounting Core unification, not solved here.
  `linksForAny()` bridges the two on the READ side only (merges
  `transaction_links` with a `paymentApplications` lookup into one
  `RelatedDoc[]` shape) so a "Linked transactions" panel works for either kind
  of org without touching the QBO sync write path — see
  `app/(app)/accounting/transactions/[id]/page.tsx` (native) and
  `app/(app)/invoices/[id]/page.tsx` (QBO-mirror) for the two consumers.
- **Receivable Composition** (`lib/receivable-composition.ts`): shared classifier
  splitting open AR into workable / blocked / not-yet-due groups. Powers the
  Dashboard widget and the Board's click-to-filter strip. Chart colors are
  validated per theme (3 semantic hues: rose=blocked, sky=workable,
  emerald=current) — don't hand-pick a hue per category.
- **QBO Reports API:** modernized (`testing_migration=true`) is validated and in
  use. `app/api/reporting/[type]` serves native QBO/Xero reports (Reporting
  module, gated by `organisations.reporting_enabled`).
- **Owner escalation portal** (`app/owner-portal/[token]/`): no-login, token-auth,
  30-day expiry, ownership re-checked live on every request.
- **Inventory & manufacturing (perpetual, FIFO by lot):**
  - **Item kinds** (`lib/inventory/item-kinds.ts`) are the single source of truth
    for accounting behaviour. `apItems.productType` ∈ FinishedProduct | StockItem
    | RawMaterial | WorkInProgress | NonInventory | Service. Each declares
    tracked/sellable/buyable/producible/consumable. `kindOf()` normalises;
    `qboItemType()` keeps the legacy `itemType` (Service/Non-Inventory/Inventory)
    in sync for reporting. Tracked items carry `assetAccountId` + `cogsAccountId`
    (default to the **Inventory Asset** / **COGS** system accounts, added to
    `SYSTEM_ACCOUNTS`, resolved by subtype `Inventory` / `SuppliesMaterialsCogs`).
  - **Valuation engine** (`lib/inventory/valuation.ts`): a LOT (`inventory_lots`)
    is a dated FIFO cost layer. `commitReceipt` creates one on purchase/production;
    `planIssue`/`commitIssue` relieve oldest-first (or specific picked lots) at
    exact cost; `reverseInventoryByEntry` unwinds a document's lots/movements
    (refuses if stock was consumed downstream). `recalcItemCache` recomputes the
    cached `on_hand_qty`/`inv_value` from open lots after every change (neon has
    no transactions — plan read-only, then commit, then recalc). Every movement
    is logged in `inventory_movements`.
  - **Posting** (`lib/accounting/documents.ts`): Bill/Expense of a tracked item
    routes the debit to its Inventory Asset (not expense) and creates a receipt
    lot; Invoice/SalesReceipt appends **Dr COGS / Cr Inventory** at FIFO cost
    (home currency, appended after `toHome`) on top of Dr AR/Bank–Cr Revenue.
    Credit notes / vendor credits (returns) don't move stock yet — known TODO.
    The form now carries `itemId` (+ lot no/expiry on purchase lines) to posting.
  - **BOM** (`boms`/`bom_lines`, `/api/inventory/boms*`, `components/bom-register.tsx`,
    `/accounting/bom`): recipe of output←input items. **Production build**
    (`lib/inventory/production.ts`, `/api/inventory/production`,
    `components/production-console.tsx`, `/production/build`) consumes picked
    input lots and produces an output lot at the summed cost — Dr output Inventory
    / Cr each input Inventory, no P&L. `production_runs`/`production_consumptions`
    record it. "Production" is a numbered DocType (BUILD- series).
  - **Procure-to-pay (three-way match):** PO (`trade_documents`, non-accounting)
    → **Goods Receipt** (`goods_receipts`/`_lines`, `lib/inventory/receiving.ts`
    `postGoodsReceipt`: Dr Inventory / Cr **GR/IR** clearing + FIFO lot, lot #
    captured here) → **Bill from receipt** (`billFromReceipts`: reuses
    postDocument with GR/IR-clearing lines → Dr GR/IR / Cr A/P). GR/IR is a
    system account (subtype `GRIRClearing`). PO lines carry pack-level ordering
    (`order_uom`/`pack_level`/`units_per_order_unit`/`ordered_base_qty`) +
    `received_qty`/`billed_qty`. UI: `/accounting/receiving`
    (`receiving-console.tsx`). Reports: Open POs / Expected Bills (open GR/IR) /
    Open Bills + inventory Expected-Qty (`/api/inventory/procurement-reports`,
    `components/procurement-reports.tsx`). Every step is bypassable (receive
    with no PO; a direct Bill with inventory items still posts Dr Inventory /
    Cr A/P and makes lots).
  - **Order-to-cash (sales mirror):** Sales Order (`trade_documents` kind
    `SalesOrder`, non-accounting, pack-level ordering from finished-product SKUs)
    → **Shipment** (`sales_shipments`/`shipment_lines`, `lib/inventory/shipping.ts`
    `postShipment`: **COGS at shipment** — Dr COGS / Cr Inventory at FIFO cost)
    → **Invoice from shipment** (`invoiceFromShipments`: Dr A/R / Cr Revenue;
    invoice lines carry no `itemId` so COGS is NOT re-posted). UI:
    `/accounting/shipping` (`shipping-console.tsx`). SOs are fulfilled via
    Shipping, never converted. Reports: Open SOs / Awaiting Invoicing / Open
    Invoices (`/api/inventory/sales-reports`, `components/sales-reports.tsx`);
    Stock Status shows Committed (on SO) and Available = on-hand+expected−committed.
    Bypassable: ship with no SO; a direct Invoice with inventory items still
    posts revenue + COGS itself. (`receivedQty`/`billedQty` on trade lines are
    reused as shipped/invoiced for SOs.)
  - **Job work / subcontracting** (`job_work_orders`, `lib/inventory/jobwork.ts`,
    UI `/accounting/jobwork`): send owned material to a vendor for external
    processing (knitting, dyeing, ...) and receive it back transformed, still
    owned throughout — neither a purchase (fresh cost, ownership transfers)
    nor a sale (ownership leaves) fits this, so it's its own pattern.
    `dispatchToJobWorker` relieves the sent item's FIFO lots into a new system
    account, **Materials with Job Worker** (subtype `JobWorkMaterials`) — Dr
    clearing / Cr Inventory, no COGS/revenue since ownership never transfers.
    `receiveFromJobWork` creates a lot for the RECEIVED item at (carried
    material cost from that clearing account + a processing fee), and records
    the **fee-only** portion into the ordinary `goods_receipts`/
    `goods_receipt_lines` tables so the ALREADY-EXISTING three-way-match Bill
    flow (`billFromReceipts`) bills the job worker for their charge completely
    unchanged — the material cost never touches GR/IR, so it's never billed
    (correctly: you don't owe the vendor for material you already own).
    Proven end-to-end on a 100k-unit textile scenario (Yarn → Knitter → Grey
    Fabric → Dyer → Dyed Fabric → in-house cut-&-sew production → Shirts):
    the Job Work clearing account nets to **exactly zero** once every dispatch
    is matched by its receipt.
  - **Not yet:** UoM conversion on Bill/invoice/BOM lines (qty assumed base UoM
    outside PO/SO/receiving/shipping); sales/purchase-return inventory;
    standard-cost variances; multicurrency GR/IR & AR/AP FX variance.
  - **Order-linked traceability & delay tracking** (Phase 1-3 of the textile
    roadmap, `lib/inventory/manufacturing-orders.ts`/`jobwork.ts`/
    `lib/accounting/trade-documents.ts`, `app/(app)/accounting/trade/
    sales-orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `inngest/functions/chase.ts`'s
    `supplyChainWatchdog`): `manufacturingOrders`, `jobWorkOrders`, and
    PurchaseOrder-kind `tradeDocuments` all carry an optional `salesOrderId`
    — set at creation via a picker in each console/form, never required, so
    an org not doing make-to-order manufacturing sees nothing new. The
    **Order Production Tracker** (`/accounting/trade/sales-orders/[id]`,
    reached via a "Track" link on each Sales Order row) aggregates every
    linked PO/Job Work/MO plus shipments (`shipment_lines.so_id`, already
    existed) into one timeline — no new per-document detail views, it only
    aggregates existing ones. `jobWorkOrders.expectedReturnDate` (new) and
    PurchaseOrder's existing `expiryDate` (already labeled "Delivery date"
    in the PO form — reused rather than duplicated) are what the daily
    `supplyChainWatchdog` cron compares against `today`, upserting
    `supply_chain_alerts` (resolved, never deleted, once the doc closes or
    the date clears) — same one-sweep-across-every-org shape as the existing
    `brokenPromiseSweep`. Surfaced three places off the one `GET
    /api/inventory/alerts` list: the Tracker's per-step badges, the
    **Delivery Risk** report (`/accounting/reports/delivery-risk`), and a
    new header bell (`components/alert-bell.tsx`) — the first in-app
    notification surface in the app (previously chase-email-only). Material
    reservation/reallocation and planned-vs-actual costing are the next
    phases, designed for but not built — see the roadmap plan for the full
    picture.

## ⚠️ Migration-drift bugs found & fixed (2026-08-29)

Running a from-scratch `npm run db:migrate` against a fresh database (rather
than an already-provisioned one) surfaced two real, previously-latent bugs —
columns the application code has always required that no migration ever
actually created/relaxed. Both are fixed (`0066_external_id_nullable.sql`,
`0067_invoices_source.sql`), but the lesson generalizes: **a schema change
someone applied by hand or via `drizzle-kit push` on a live database, without
also writing the equivalent migration file, is invisible until someone
migrates a truly fresh database.** If a column exists in `db/schema.ts` and
the app writes to it, but you can't find the `ALTER TABLE`/`CREATE TABLE`
that added it in `db/migrations/`, that's this exact bug waiting to happen
again — worth a periodic from-scratch migration test on a throwaway database.

- `accounts`/`ap_items`/`ap_tax_rates.external_id` carried a `NOT NULL` left
  over from before these tables supported native (non-QBO/Xero) records —
  `schema.ts` has declared all three nullable for a long time ("null for
  native records"), and every native insert path has always sent
  `externalId: null`, but no migration ever dropped the constraint. Blocked
  **every** native account/item/tax-rate creation on a fresh database.
- `invoices.source` is written by `lib/qbo-sync.ts`'s QBO ingestion inserts
  AND `lib/accounting/documents.ts`'s `bridgeNativeInvoice`, and read nowhere
  (grepped — no logic depends on it, so backfilling existing rows to
  `'native'` is safe), but the column was never migrated at all. Blocked
  **QBO invoice sync itself**, not just the native bridge — the more
  consequential of the two.

## Data Studio (bulk import/export, `app/(app)/batch/`)

Spreadsheet-driven bulk operations against QBO/Xero — import, export, update,
delete for ~32 entity types. `lib/batch/entities.ts` is the registry: each
entity declares its `columns`, a `build` (sheet → QBO payload), `toRows`
(QBO record → sheet rows), and the `refs`/`reverseRefs` lists to resolve.

**Three things must agree, or a column is a lie:**

1. `columns` — what the header row promises
2. `toRows` — what the export actually fills in
3. `build` — what the import actually reads back

A column present in (1) but missing from (2) exports blank; missing from (3)
means the user's edit is silently discarded on import. Bank Deposits had NINE
such columns (`Received From` most damagingly — the payer name, without which
an export is useless for reclassifying). When adding or touching an entity,
check all three, and prefer a scripted round-trip check (feed a realistic QBO
payload through `toRows` → write the xlsx → `build` it back) over eyeballing.

**Update (modify) always re-reads the record and uses ITS SyncToken, never
the sheet's.** A downloaded sheet's SyncToken is only as current as the
moment it was downloaded — anything touching the record afterward (another
job, a scheduled sync, or just time passing before the edited sheet is
re-uploaded) makes it stale. QuickBooks rejects a stale SyncToken with
"[name] is working on this at the same time" — its generic wording for
"this token isn't current," which fires whether or not anyone is actually
concurrently editing it. `commitOneDoc` (`lib/batch/commit-one.ts`) already
re-reads the record for the estimate-link check and the CustomField merge
(the two full-update fixes above); it just wasn't using that fresh read's
SyncToken in the outgoing payload — still sending the sheet's stale one,
which is exactly what surfaced this false "multiple users" rejection in a
single-user org. Falls back to the sheet's value only if the re-read itself
fails, so a network hiccup doesn't turn into a hard failure when a
plausible token was already in hand.

**Every write operation (import, delete, bulk-edit, update) must go through
ONE shared per-document commit function — `lib/batch/commit-one.ts`'s
`commitOneDoc`.** Fixing a bug in shared logic doesn't help if a second,
independent copy of that logic exists elsewhere and keeps running unfixed.
That's exactly what happened here: `commitOneDoc`'s sparse-vs-full-update
fix (below) was correct, but `commit-runner.ts` — the whole-job runner
behind the dedicated `/batch/modify` screen (`/api/batch/upload/commit`,
used whenever a job is small enough to run inline, ≤100 docs) — had its
OWN independent inline copy of build+estimate-safety-check+sparse+qboPost,
never updated. A user editing a two-line deposit down to one line and
re-uploading through `/batch/modify` kept hitting the still-broken copy,
appending the edited line on top of the original two. `commit-runner.ts`
now calls `commitOneDoc` like `chunk-runner.ts` already did — one
implementation, not two. **Lesson: after any correctness fix to shared
logic, grep the whole tree for the pattern you just fixed** (`sparse`, in
this case) to confirm there isn't a second copy still doing the old thing.

**Update (modify) on a line-item entity must NOT be a sparse patch —
`lib/batch/commit-one.ts`'s `shapeModifyPayload`.** QuickBooks' documented
sparse-update rule for the `Line` collection: a line without its own
line-level `Id` is a NEW line; anything not mentioned is left alone. Data
Studio never round-trips QBO's per-line ids (only the document-level
`Id`/`SyncToken`), so every line in an update payload is always id-less —
under `sparse:true` that meant every "Update" on a downloaded, edited sheet
APPENDED the sheet's lines instead of replacing the old ones (the actual
bug behind "I edited the lines and QuickBooks shows extra ones now"). Fix:
whenever the built payload carries a `Line` array, do a FULL (non-sparse)
update instead — QBO then treats the submitted lines as the complete new
truth. The cost of going full is that any header field QBO tracks that the
builder doesn't send gets reset; the sales/purchase builders already model
tax fields (`GlobalTaxCalculation`, per-line `TaxCodeRef`) on both create
and update, so that wasn't a new gap — `CustomField` was the one real one,
now merged forward from the existing record. Entities with no `docKey`
(list entities, Transfer, TimeActivity, …) never carry a `Line` array and
are untouched — still a correct, safe sparse patch.

**Open investigation — removing a line from a QBO Deposit.** A full update on a
Deposit returns **200 OK but keeps every line omitted from the payload** (seen in
the importer and in a controlled `deposit-reduce` diagnostic that echoed QBO's own
line objects back). A first delete+recreate fix was reverted: it gives the deposit
a NEW internal Id and resets its bank reconciliation, which isn't acceptable. Still
being determined (via the read-only-plus-one-mutation `deposit-reduce` diagnostic,
now using a real `?operation=update` and reporting the response Id) is whether an
in-place line delete is possible at all, or whether the earlier tests were confounded
by omitting `?operation=update`. Don't ship another deposit-line-removal fix on the
money path until that's settled. Verify any change here
with `shapeModifyPayload` directly (pure, no I/O) rather than a live script
against `qboPost`/`qboReadOne` — tsx's module interop doesn't preserve ESM
live bindings for named function imports, so monkey-patching those from
outside the module silently no-ops and the real functions run instead.

**Every write operation (import, delete, bulk-edit) runs on ONE shared,
resumable engine — `lib/batch/lease.ts`.** It didn't used to: upload had a
lease/cursor design (chunk-runner.ts), delete ran its whole loop synchronously
in the HTTP handler with a single `db.update` at the very end, and bulk-edit
`await`ed its whole job inline before the response returned (its client-side
poll() was dead code — the job was always already "done" by the time the
first poll fired). Both of the non-upload paths meant: past a few hundred
records, or any hiccup, the platform could kill the function mid-loop with
an unknown number of QuickBooks writes already done and **zero record of
which ones**. For delete that's worse than it sounds — there's no source
file left afterward to diff against and see what's missing.

The fix generalized upload's pattern rather than inventing three fixes:
`claimChunk`/`recordItem`/`finishChunkCall`/`runChunkLoop` in `lease.ts` are
the whole primitive (atomic UPDATE-based, since neon-http has no
transactions — see the gotcha below). `chunk-runner.ts` (upload/modify),
`delete-chunk-runner.ts`, and `fieldedit-chunk-runner.ts` are thin adapters:
each just supplies "what is item N" and "how do I process one item."

**Processing is server-driven, not browser-driven.** The client used to
`while(!done)`-loop calling `/api/batch/upload/chunk` itself — so closing the
tab, a laptop sleeping, or a flaky connection outlasting the retry budget
silently stopped the import at whatever cursor it reached. `runBatchChunkLoop`
(`inngest/functions/batch.ts`) now drives every chunked job via Inngest event
self-chaining (`step.sendEvent` back to itself until `done`), independent of
any browser tab. The client still fires one best-effort "nudge" after
starting a job (matching the existing dual-trigger pattern in
`commit-runner.ts`) and then just polls `GET /api/batch/jobs/[id]` for
progress — the same poll() function now works for all four flows, not just
Xero's legacy whole-job path.

**`lib/batch/reap.ts` resumes before it gives up.** The old reaper (in both
`GET /jobs` and `GET /jobs/[id]`, duplicated) only ever flipped a stuck job to
"failed" after 5 minutes, with a vague "stopped part-way" message that never
said how many records were never even attempted — which is the exact shape
of the reported bug (a 300-row import showing 70 success / 1 failed, with the
other 229 unaccounted for anywhere). Now: a stuck CHUNKED job (leaseUntil is
the structural marker — set, already-expired, at job creation by every
chunked start route) gets nudged via the same Inngest event rather than
failed outright, and only gives up after ~20 minutes of failed nudges, with
an honest count (`"71 of 300 attempted — the remaining 229 were never
attempted"`). A `batchJobWatchdog` cron (every 2 minutes) does the same thing
independent of anyone opening Job History, so an interrupted run self-heals
without a human noticing. Legacy whole-job runners (Xero commit, scheduled
QBO imports) never set `leaseUntil` — that's what tells the reaper/watchdog
they're not chunk-resumable, so they still just age out at the original
5-minute cutoff. **This distinction matters**: a watchdog query that also
matched `leaseUntil IS NULL` would treat every *healthy, currently-running*
legacy job as "stale" on every tick and fire a second, concurrent processor
at it — a real duplicate-QBO-writes bug caught during review, not shipped.

**One narrow, pre-existing risk this doesn't close**: if the QBO write for
one item succeeds but the process is killed before `recordItem` commits that
result, a retry reprocesses the same item — a possible duplicate create, and
if it happens the id is also never logged, so Undo can't find it either. This
was already true of the original upload-only design; extracting it to a
shared engine didn't add or remove the exposure. It's rare (the window is one
DB write, not the whole chunk) but real — worth a proper idempotency-key
design if it ever shows up in practice.

**Dropdowns live in `lib/batch/dropdowns.ts`, shared by the template AND the
export.** They were originally only in the template route, which is backwards:
the export is the file people actually edit, so it's the file that most needs
valid picks. `refKindForColumn` (`lib/batch/ref-columns.ts`) maps a column name
to its QBO list; `UNION_COLUMNS` handles columns that legitimately accept more
than one kind (a deposit's "Received From" may be a customer, vendor OR
employee — offering only customers makes a real vendor refund look invalid).
CSV can't carry validations, so xlsx is the format to prefer for round trips.

`RefResolver.preload` is parallel and swallows per-list failures, so adding
kinds costs ~the slowest list, not the sum.

## Where things live

- `app/(app)/` — the authed app (dashboard, board, invoices, customers, payables,
  reporting, settings, admin, …). `app/(app)/layout.tsx` = shell + ThemeProvider.
- `app/api/` — route handlers. `app/owner-portal/`, `app/register/` — public.
- `components/` — `board-list.tsx`, `sidebar.tsx`, `data-provider.tsx` (client
  data context), `theme-provider.tsx`, UI primitives in `ui.tsx`.
- `db/schema.ts` — the whole schema. `db/migrations/` — SQL + `meta/_journal.json`.
- `lib/` — domain logic: `ledger.ts` (GL engine), `portal.ts` (recompute/tokens),
  `qbo-sync.ts`/`xero-sync.ts`, `mailer.ts`, `escalation-types.ts`,
  `receivable-composition.ts`, `format.ts`, `crypto.ts`, `api.ts`, `billing.ts`.
- `inngest/` — background jobs (scheduled chases). `scripts/` — migrate/seed/backfill.
- `mobile/` — React Native (Expo) mobile app, separate `npm` project (its own
  `package.json`/`node_modules`, not part of the Next.js build). Organised by
  **department** (`mobile/src/departments.ts`, role-gated): **Operations**
  (Receiving / Production / Shipping) and **Receivables** (the rep portal —
  overview, invoice list + detail with promise/dispute/note/stage actions,
  escalations, customers). See `mobile/CLAUDE.md`. Talks
  to the same `app/api/` routes as the web app, but via a bearer-token auth
  path (`app/api/mobile/auth/*`, `lib/mobile-auth.ts`) since RN can't use the
  httpOnly session cookie — `lib/api.ts`'s `requireOrg()`/`requireAuth()`
  accept `Authorization: Bearer <token>` as a fallback, re-validated against
  the DB exactly like the cookie path. Not yet run on a device/simulator.

## Working style

- Commit messages are detailed and explain the *why* — a fresh session should be
  able to reconstruct recent work from `git log`.
- Branch off `main` for anything non-trivial; `main` auto-deploys.
- End commit messages with the Co-Authored-By trailer.
