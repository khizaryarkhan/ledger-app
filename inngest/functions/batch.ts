/**
 * Drives a chunked job (upload/modify, delete, or bulk-edit) to completion
 * SERVER-SIDE, one bounded slice per invocation, self-chaining via
 * step.sendEvent until the job reports done.
 *
 * This replaces what used to be a browser-tab-driven loop for uploads (the
 * client called /api/batch/upload/chunk in a `while(!done)` loop) and a
 * fully-synchronous single request for delete and bulk-edit. Either design
 * means the import/delete/edit stops the moment the browser stops asking for
 * it — a closed tab, a laptop sleeping, a flaky connection outlasting the
 * client's retry budget, or (for delete/bulk-edit) simply outrunning the
 * platform's request time limit. The job would sit at whatever cursor it
 * reached, silently, until the stale-job reaper eventually marked it
 * "failed" with no record of how many records were never even attempted —
 * which is the exact shape of bug reported: a 300-row import showing 70
 * success / 1 failed, with the other 229 unaccounted for anywhere in the UI.
 *
 * Each invocation here is short and durable (the shared engine in
 * lib/batch/lease.ts persists every single item before moving to the next),
 * so retries are safe: a retried step just re-reads the current cursor and
 * continues — it can't duplicate or skip work. `dispatchChunk` decides which
 * processor a job needs; `input.fieldEdit` is what distinguishes a bulk-edit
 * job from a sheet-based one, since both are stored with operation="modify"
 * (bulk-edit deliberately reuses that value so Job History's existing
 * operation labels/icons keep working without a schema change).
